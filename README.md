## ðŸ“– Project Overview

### The Problem
The Government of India provides an Open API for MGNREGA data, but it's not accessible to common citizens who:
- Are not technically savvy
- Have low data literacy
- May have low or no literacy
- Need information in their local language
- Cannot interpret complex data structures

### Our Solution
A bilingual (Hindi/English), user-friendly web application that:
- âœ… Provides simple, visual representation of data
- âœ… Explains what the data means in plain language
- âœ… Compares district performance with state averages
- âœ… **NEW: Compare multiple states and districts side-by-side**
- âœ… Auto-detects user's district (optional)
- âœ… Works offline with locally cached data
- âœ… Designed for mobile-first rural users
